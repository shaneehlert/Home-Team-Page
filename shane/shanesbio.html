<p>Hi my name is shane. I am currently attending General Assembly taking the Web Development Immersive. I am learning to create apps with html,css,javascript,jquery,ruby, and ruby on rails. On my free time i like to work on cars and hardware in computers. I like to play video games and hopefully later on learn to create simple games and move forward from there.
